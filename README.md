A blog I made following an online tutorial. The python is all mine, but the css is not. My plan is to slowly learn web development and change the style to my own customer design as I go... than add more features to make it my own completely. That's the plan, we will see how busy I get with uni

About two weeks from finishing and uploading this and I am thinking of completely abandoning this project and starting from scratch doing it my own way from the start. There is 10 thousand lines of css I didnt write and have no chance of ripping out and replacing any time soon... So the thought process is instead I just build it from the ground up again but with what I know now and then update it as I go with what I know. I think that would be easier then trying to replace what is here as I go.... I don't know, perhaps replacing as I go is better practice for the real world. I'll think about this.
